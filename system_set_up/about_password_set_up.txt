passwd pi <enter, enter pi password>
sudo passwd root <enter, enter root password>

sudo mv /etc/sudoers.d/010_pi-nopasswd /etc/sudoers.d/010_pi-nopasswd~

'root' password won't be asked while calling 'sudo <command>' from 'pi',
because 'pi' account is set up with sudo rigths by default.

However, it will be asked while calling 'su -'
